# 5th Year Subject Choices
## [an eslcc project](https://eslcc.club)

This is a webapp to help students of the European School of Luxembourg 1 to make their subject choices. It does this
by showing them which combinations of choices are possible, warning them if they don't follow the guidelines, and allowing
them to generate and print a pre-filled choice form.

The app is written in TypeScript with React.

The project is still at a very early stage and we are not accepting contributions at this time.
